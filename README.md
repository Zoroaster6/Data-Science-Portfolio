## Projects

### 1. Web Scraping & Analysis of Online Bookstore Data
*   **Description:** Developed a web scraper using Python (Requests, BeautifulSoup) to collect data for books from the 'Books to Scrape' website. The scraped data was then cleaned, processed with Pandas, and analyzed to uncover insights about pricing and rating distributions.
*   **Skills:** `Web Scraping`, `Data Collection`, `Data Cleaning`, `Pandas`, `BeautifulSoup`.
